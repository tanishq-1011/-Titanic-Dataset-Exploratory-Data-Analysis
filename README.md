Titanic Dataset: Exploratory Data Analysis
In this notebook, we're going to analyse the famous Titanic dataset from Kaggle. The dataset is meant for supervised machine learning, but we're only going to do some exploratory analysis at this stage.

We'll try to answer the following questions:

Who were the passengers on the Titanic? (age, gender, class.. etc).
What deck were the passengers on and how does that relate to their class?
Who was alone and who was with family?
What factors helped someone survive the sinking?
